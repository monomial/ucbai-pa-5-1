- **Demographic Insights**: Younger demographics (under 30) have a higher likelihood of accepting coupons, which may correlate with their more frequent usage of coffee shops for social and work-related activities.
- **Economic Factors**: There is a noticeable correlation between lower income levels and the acceptance of coupons, indicating a sensitivity to pricing among this demographic group.
